### Short history of Visual Basic
The successor to Visual Basic 6.0, dubbed VB.NET and released in 2002, completely changed the ethos of the product, and turned out to be the death knell for the original idea of Visual Basic. While Visual Basic was an easy on-ramp for developers with heavy abstractions, VB.NET was a more complex, full-featured programming language.
### What are Visual Basic advantages?
Visual Basic is user friendly and interactive. Users can code, test and debug with ease, given that Visual Basic offers ready-made controls and MDSN (Microsoft Developer Network) assistance for technical issues. Visual basic is a powerful front-end tool. It is able to achieve simple and complex business requisites effectively and efficiently.
